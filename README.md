Starting out on a new minimal Journey

-- about me sublevel heading and redo grammar

Hi everyone market has apparently landed me, a mechanical engineer
into the world of analytics. I hence plan to  now be well versed from 
start to end i.e. where data gets generated at the software/
application level to the collection processing and analysis level.
From there I plan on to get back to my core engineer and integrate
this knowlede at a ground level.
